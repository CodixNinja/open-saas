title: User Permissions
---

This reference will help you understand how the user permissions work in this template.
This includes the user roles, subscription tiers and statuses, and how to authorize access to certain pages and components.

## User Entity

The `User` entity within your app is defined in the `main.wasp` file:

```tsx title="main.wasp" ins="User: {}"
entity User {=psl
  id                        Int             @id @default(autoincrement())
  email                     String?         @unique
  password                  String?
  createdAt                 DateTime        @default(now())
  lastActiveTimestamp       DateTime        @default(now())
  isAdmin                   Boolean         @default(false)
  isEmailVerified           Boolean         @default(false)
  emailVerificationSentAt   DateTime?
  passwordResetSentAt       DateTime?
  stripeId                  String? 
  checkoutSessionId         String?
  hasPaid                   Boolean         @default(false)
  subscriptionTier          String?
  subscriptionStatus        String?
  sendEmail                 Boolean         @default(false)
  datePaid                  DateTime?
  credits                   Int             @default(3)
  relatedObject             RelatedObject[]
  externalAuthAssociations  SocialLogin[]
  contactFormMessages       ContactFormMessage[]
  referrer                  Referrer?       @relation(fields: [referrerId], references: [id])
  referrerId                Int?        
psl=}
```

We store all pertinent information to the user, including Auth, Subscription, and Stripe information.

## Stripe and Subscriptions

We use Stripe to handle all of our subscription payments. The `User` entity has a number of fields that are related to Stripe and their ability to access features behind the paywall:

```tsx title="main.wasp" {4-10}
entity User {=psl
  id                        Int             @id @default(autoincrement())
  //...
  stripeId                  String? 
  checkoutSessionId         String?
  hasPaid                   Boolean         @default(false)
  subscriptionTier          String?
  subscriptionStatus        String?
  datePaid                  DateTime?
  credits                   Int             @default(3)
  //...
psl=}
```

- `stripeId`: The Stripe customer ID. This is created by Stripe on checkout and used to identify the customer.
- `checkoutSessionId`: The Stripe checkout session ID. This is created by Stripe on checkout and used to identify the checkout session.
- `hasPaid`: A boolean that indicates whether the user has paid for a subscription or not.
- `subscriptionTier`: The subscription tier the user is on. This is set by the app and is used to determine what features the user has access to. By default, we have two tiers: `hobby-tier` and `pro-tier`.
- `subscriptionStatus`: The subscription status of the user. This is set by Stripe and is used to determine whether the user has access to the app or not. By default, we have four statuses: `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, and `deleted`.
- `credits` (optional): You can allow a user to trial your product with a limited number of credits before they have to pay.

### Subscription Statuses

In general, we determine if a user has paid for an initial subscription by checking if the `hasPaid` field is true. If it is, we know that the user has paid for a subscription and we can grant them access to the app.

The `subscriptionStatus` field is set by Stripe within your webhook handler and is used to signify more detailed information on the user's current status. By default, the template handles four statuses: `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, and `deleted`.

- When `active` the user has paid for a subscription and has full access to the app. 

- When `canceled`, the user has canceled their subscription and has access to the app until the end of their billing period. 

- When `deleted`, the user has reached the end of their subscription period after canceling and no longer has access to the app.

- When `past_due`, the user's automatic subscription renewal payment was declined (e.g. their credit card expired). You can choose how to handle this status within your app. For example, you can send the user an email to update their payment information:
```tsx title="src/server/webhooks/stripe.ts" 
import { emailSender } from '@wasp/email/index.js';
//...

if (subscription.status === 'past_due') {
  const updatedCustomer = await context.entities.User.update({
    where: {
      id: customer.id,
    },
    data: {
      subscriptionStatus: 'past_due',
    },
  });

  if (updatedCustomer.email) {
    await emailSender.send({
      to: updatedCustomer.email,
      subject: 'Your Payment is Past Due',
      text: 'Please update your payment information to continue using our service.',
      html: '...',
    });
  }
}
```

See the client-side authorization section below for more info on how to handle these statuses within your app.

### Subscription Tiers

The `subscriptionTier` field is used to determine what features the user has access to. 

By default, we have two tiers: `hobby-tier` and `pro-tier`. 

You can add more tiers by adding more products and price IDs to your Stripe product  and updating environment variables in your `.env.server` file as well as the relevant code in your app.

See the [Stripe Integration Guide](/guides/stripe-integration) for more info on how to do this.

## User Roles

At the moment, we have two user roles: `admin` and `user`. This is defined within the `isAdmin` field in the `User` entity:

```tsx title="main.wasp" {7}
entity User {=psl
  id                        Int             @id @default(autoincrement())
  email                     String?         @unique
  password                  String?
  createdAt                 DateTime        @default(now())
  lastActiveTimestamp       DateTime        @default(now())
  isAdmin                   Boolean         @default(false)
//...
psl=}
```

As an Admin, a user has access to the Admin dashboard, along with the user table where they can view and search for users, and edit and update information manually if necessary

// TODO: add screenshot of user table

### Client-side Authorization

All authenticated users have access to the user-facing app, which is the app that sits behind the login. You can easily authorize access to general users from within the `main.wasp` file by adding the `authRequired: true` property to the `page` definition:

```tsx title="main.wasp" {3}
route AccountRoute { path: "/account", to: AccountPage }
page AccountPage {
  authRequired: true,
  component: import Account from "@client/app/AccountPage"
}
```

This will automatically redirect users to the login page if they are not logged in.

If you want more fine-grained control over what users can access, there are two Wasp-specific options:
1. When you define the `authRequired: true` property on the `page` definition, Wasp automatically passes the User object to the page component. Here you can check for certain user properties before authorizing access:

```tsx title="ExamplePage.tsx" {1}
export default function Example({ user }: { user: User }) 

if (user.subscriptionStatus === 'past_due') {
  return (<span>Your subscription is past due. Please update your payment information.</span>)
}
if (user.subscriptionStatus === 'canceled') {
  return (<span>Your will susbscription end on 01.01.2024</span>)
}
if (user.subscriptionStatus === 'active') {
  return (<span>Thanks so much for your support!</span>)
}
```

2. Or you can take advantage of the `useAuth` hook and check for certain user properties before authorizing access to certain pages or components:

```tsx title="ExamplePage.tsx" {1, 4}
import useAuth from '@wasp/auth/useAuth';

export default function ExampleHomePage() {
  const { data: user } = useAuth();

  return (
    <h1> Hi {user.email || 'there'} ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
  )
}
```

### Server-side Authorization

You can also authorize access to server-side operations by adding a check to for a logged in user on the `context.user` object which is passed to all operations in Wasp:

```tsx title="src/server/actions.ts" 
export const updateCurrentUser: UpdateCurrentUser<...> = async (args, context) => {
  if (!context.user) {
    throw new HttpError(401); // throw an error if user is not logged in
  }

  if (context.user.subscriptionStatus === 'past_due') {
    throw new HttpError(403, 'Your subscription is past due. Please update your payment information.');
  }
  //...
}
```
